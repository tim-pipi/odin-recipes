    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chocolate chip cookie recipe makes delicious cookies with crisp edges and chewy middles.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Butter:</strong> This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Water:</strong> A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
